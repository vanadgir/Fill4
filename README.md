# Fill 4
This game is my term project for BU MET CS 601 Web Application Development. I hope you enjoy it!

### One Rule
The only rule is that regions cannot be the same color if they share a wall. If you manage to color all the regions, then you have won. 

### Game Idea
The game uses the concept of the 4-Color Theorem in graph theory. However, in this project, I do not guarantee all randomly generated Voronoi diagrams are planar. You may run into some unsolvable cases. 

### Available Color Palettes
I have tried to include many palettes which should be friendly to different types of colorblindness. However, if you have any suggestions for other palettes to add, please feel free to message or email me and I will try to include them!  In the best case scenario, I will add a color selector for the player to be able to pick their own colors - however, I have a few other features to work on before getting to it.
